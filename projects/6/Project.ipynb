        "In Volume 1, **Frodo** is peacefully getting on with his **Hobbit** life in **Bag End** in the **Shire**, until **Gandalf** the Grey confirms his suspicion that the **Ring** inherited by Frodo from his uncle **Bilbo** is none other than the **Ring** of Power. The Ring is being searched for by the Dark Lord **Sauron**, who sends the **Nine Riders** (**Nazgul**) to find it. The Ring is no longer safe in the Shire, so Frodo, **Sam**, **Merry** and **Pippin** set out from **Hobbiton**, on a quest to keep it safe. In the meantime, Gandalf leaves on a mysterious journey and is in fact imprisoned on **Orthanc** in **Isengard** by the wizard **Saruman**, who has joined forces with the Dark Lord. As Frodo and Sam leave home, they happen upon a company of **Elves**, who are headed for the harbour. **Gildor** and his fellow Elves intend to leave **Middle Earth** and go West.  \n",
        "With the Nine hot on their heels, the Hobbits' only chance to escape the Shire unnoticed is through the **Old Forest**, an ancient, dark place around which many menacing legends are told. They are promptly lost, and only just saved from being swallowed alive by an ancient willow, by **Tom Bombadil**. Tom lives with **Goldberry**, daughter of the river, in a house in the Old Forest.  \n",
        "Once they succeed in leaving the Forest, the Hobbits' lack of experience puts them in danger from the many spies serving Sauron and Saruman. Luckily, in **Bree**, on their way out of the Shire, they meet **Aragorn**. He introduces himself as a Ranger from the North. Little do the Hobbits know that he is in fact the son of **Arathorn**, heir of **Isildur** son of **Elendil**, and thus to the throne of **Gondor**. Helped by Aragorn, the Hobbits manage to escape Bree with **Bill** the pony.   \n",
        "The Hobbits and Aragorn are pursued by the Nine, who gravely wound Frodo with a magical **Morgul** blade forged in **Mordor**. The only place he can hope for recovery is **Rivendell**, home of the Elves. Upon hearing of their plight, **Elrond**, lord of Rivendell, sends out riders to aid the Hobbits. The Elf **Glorfindel** finds them in the nick of time and hurries off with Frodo to Rivendell.  \n",
        "While the Hobbits are in Rivendell, they take part in a Council, to which Elrond had summoned many **Elves**, **Men** and **Dwarves** from all around Middle Earth. During this Council, it is decided that the Ring must be destroyed, and the Hobbits, Aragorn and Gandalf, are joined by the Dwarf **Gimli** son of **Gloin**, the Elf **Legolas** of **Mirkwood** and the **man** **Boromir** son of **Denethor**, steward of Gondor. The goal of the Fellowship of the Ring is to take the Ring to Mordor, home of Sauron, as it is the only place it can be destroyed.  \n",
        "They are fOrced to go through **Moria**, ancient Dwarf mine, where they hope to be helped by Gimli's cousin **Balin**/ Balin disappeared in the Mine a long time ago, searching for a dwarven Ring owned by **Thrain** but not inherited by his son **Thorin**. Little does the Company know that the Dwarves in Moria have long been exterminated by **Orcs**. Not only are our travellers not met with the royal welcome they expected, they are fallen upon by an ancient spirit of the underworld. In mortal combat, Gandalf falls with him into the deep chasm and is seen no more.  \n",
        "Aragorn takes it upon himself to lead the company westwards, through **Lorien** -or **Lothlorien**-, grand realm of the Elves. They meet the Elf **Haldir**, who takes them to Lady **Galadriel** and Lord **Celeborn**. In Lorien, the Company is given boats, and travels down the river **Anduin**. They realise that they have been followed since Moria by the creature **Gollum**, an ancient being with a lifespan unnaturally long, as he had kept the Ring for many centuries before losing it to Frodo's uncle Bilbo in *The Hobbit*. Haunted still by the lure of the Ring, he is following the Company in an attempt to retrieve it.  \n",
        "Indeed, the Ring has an extraordinary power to ensnare most anybody who comes near it. It is the downfall of Boromir, who attempts to convince Frodo to take the Ring to Gondor. Frightened, Frodo runs away, followed by Sam as the Company is ambushed by Uruk-hai, servants of Saruman, who capture Merry and Pippin, and kill Boromir."

        "Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli decide to follow the Uruk-hai to save Merry and Pippin. They pursue them for many days, until they meet a group of **Rohan** soldiers on horseback, headed by **Eomer** of the House of **Eorl**. The riders tell them that the previous night they fell upon a group of Uruk-hai and killed all, noticing no Hobbits. Crestfallen, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli peruse the battlefield nonetheless, and Aragorn finds prints belonging to the Hobbits. The prints lead into Fangorn, a time-honoured forest and home of the **Ents**, tree-like beings that walk and talk. Just as the travellers are losing hope, they are met by none other than Gandalf, who has been returned from the dead until his work in Middle Earth is done. Gandalf tells the travellers of Merry and Pippin's adventures: in Fangorn, they were met by the Ent **Treebeard** and took part in an Ent Moot, during which the Ents decided to march on Isengard. The Hobbits therefore no longer need the help of their friends. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli decide to follow Gandalf to **Edoras**, capital of Rohan, to convince King **Theoden** to fight Saruman, whose servants are pillaging Rohan. Theoden, although King of Rohan, is unknowingly being controlled by his servant **Wormtongue**, who serves Saruman in secret. Gandalf succeeds in making Theoden see reason, and the soldiers of Rohan ride to the fortress of **Helm's Deep**, while **Eowyn**, Theoden's niece, takes the king’s place for the time being. The battle is won, and Gandalf leads a company of close followers to announce to Saruman that his army is no more. Meanwhile, Isengard has been destroyed by the Ents and only the tower Orthanc remains, in which Saruman and Wormtongue are taking refuge. While the two parties are discussing the situation, Wormtongue throws out of a window a stone, which is in fact endowed with magical properties. When the company returns to Edoras, Pippin, unerringly attracted to the Stone, is unable to resist the temptation to look into it. The Stone communicates with Sauron, and in order to keep an eye on Pippin from then on, Gandalf brings him to **Minas Tirith**, capital of Gondor.  In thanks for Gandalf’s help, King Theoden bequeaths Gandalf the horse **Shadowfax**, Lord of all horses, with whom Gandalf has already established a strong bond.  \n",
        "Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam have been making their way to Mordor from the Anduin. They are rapidly lost, and caught up with by Gollum. Frodo, temporary master of the Ring, has pity on the creature, and Gollum, unable to overcome the power of the Ring, becomes their guide. In the brush on the outskirts of Mordor, they are taken captive by Captain **Faramir**, who is ambushing troops rallying to the enemy. As it happens, Faramir is Boromir's brother. He, however, is stouter of heart, and able to resist the temptation of the Ring. Faramir sends the Hobbits and Gollum on their way. He is highly troubled, however, because the path Gollum intends to take is reputably dangerous. The Hobbits arrive in a dark and narrow passage above the Valley of the Dead, which leads into Mordor. Here, they lose Gollum and realise only too late that he has made a pact with the giant spider **Shelob**, to trade the Hobbits in return for the Ring. Frodo is wounded by Shelob's venomous sting and is left for dead by Sam, who decides to take the Ring and destroy it himself. He soon comes upon a company of Orcs, who take Frodo's body. Wearing the Ring which makes him invisible, Sam follows them and overhears an argument between the leader **Gorbag** and the other Orcs. Only too late does it dawn on the flabbergaster Hobbit, that Frodo must still be alive. But the doors of the Orc fortress slam shut in front of him."

Overwhelmed by his grief, he is unwilling to fight a losing battle against Mordor. Minas Tirith inevitably falls under siege however, and Gondor -aided by Rohan and the Elves- wins the battle. But the better part of the enemy's army is still in Mordor. And Frodo and Sam are at this very moment in Mordor itself. However, they must yet cross the enemy-infested land and reach **Mount Doom** unnoticed. The remnants of our army therefore march to the Black Gate of Mordor in order to draw the attention of the **Dark Tower**. They are headed by Gandalf, Aragorn, Eomer and **Beregond**, First Captain of Gondor. Beregond leads them to Mordor through the long ruined city of **Osgiliath**, a grand outpost of old which once protected Gondor from Mordor. At the Gate, the outnumbered army fights a losing battle, in the hope that their sacrifice will allow Frodo and Sam safe passage.  \n",
        "In the meantime, Sam manages to rescue Frodo. Under the disguise of Orcs, they cross the now empty lands towards Mount Doom, volcano in which the Ring was forged and only place it can be destroyed. They are ambushed by Gollum, who eventually retrieves the Ring by biting off the bearer's finger. Gollum and Ring tumble down into the fire, and Frodo and Sam are miraculously saved by the Giant Eagles who had flown to the help of the army at the Gate.  \n",

The Hobbits return to the Shire, but the adventures they have lived and ordeals they have suffered make is impossible for Frodo to resume his old peaceful way of life. He and Bilbo, who have both carried the Ring for a long time, eventually board the last ship into the West, along with most of the Elves that still remained in Middle Earth."

Indeed, while Men were only fourth in Volume 1, they become the most frequent type of character in Volume 2 (32.3%). This is significant, as a leitmotiv in *LOTR* is that the era is a turning point in the history of Middle Earth: what was previously the Golden Age of Elves is becoming the age of Men. However, the transition is precarious given the expansion of forces of Sauron and Saruman, and the growing importance of Orcs in particular.  \n",
        "Figure 5 clearly represents the break-up of the fellowship. Modularity with resolution 1.0 shows two communities; one containing Frodo, Sam and the other characters in the top left of the figure, and one containing Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli and the other characters (bottom right). Modularity calculated with resolution 0.5 (Supplementary Figure 1), however, shows different communities, which describe what we know of the plot and prove informative. Frodo and Sam, Merry and Pippin, and Legolas and Gimli each belong to their own community. However, Aragorn and Gandalf are both alone. This shows that, even when Aragorn travels with Legolas and Gimli, he remains a solitary man. Even though he later spends a lot of time with Gandalf, the two are not united as other duos.  \n",
        "The network representing character origins was also plotted (data not shown). The results seemed highly coherent with the story: Rohan, not the Shire, is now the most frequently mentioned place. This also translates the break-up of the Fellowship, as a great part of the volume is devoted to the adventures of Aragorn's company and occurs in Rohan."

        "Thus the representations of character types evolve between Volume 1 and Volume 2. Moreover, the studied parameters seem to segregate characters by type, differently from the observations made in Volume 1. Figure 6 demonstrates that it seems easier to discriminate between character types in Volume 2, than in Volume 1, based on the same information. In point of fact, while the PCA on Volume 1 (Figure 1) did not discriminate between Elves and Ainur, the PCA on Volume 2 suggests quite narrow and identifiable 95% confidence intervals (ovals) of groups formed by type. Some overlap remains, which shows that the characters are more complex and cannot be reduced to their origin, type, gender and importance.  \n",
        "Similarly to Volume 1, character importance seems to be a major factor of diversity inside each type. Indeed, importance explains 72% of PC2 (Supplementary Table 2), and Elves, Hobbits and Men seem somewhat spread out vertically in Figure 6. Interestingly, importance seems little important in discriminating between Dwarves: the Dwarf cluster is horizontal. This could be surprising, as there seems to be great heterogeneity in the Dwarves' importance: while Gimli is a protagonist, other Dwarves such as Gloin or Durin are scarcely mentioned. It seems therefore that the origin (72% of PC1) is preeminent in discriminating between Dwarves.  \n",
        "Among Gandalf, Saruman and Sauron (which form the diagonal cluster *Ainur*), both origin and importance are preeminent. Indeed, the size of the nodes in Figure 5 points to the fact that Gandalf is mentioned far more frequently than Saruman and Sauron. Furthermore, according to the way in which I defined the characters' origins, Gandalf comes from Middle Earth while Saruman comes from Isengard and Sauron, from Mordor. If I were to set the origins based on a historical analysis of Tolkien's works, the results might have been somewhat different as the Ainurs' roots are old and complex."

        "\n",
        "A node's **closeness centrality** is elevated if, on average, a \"short\" path can be drawn between it and any other node. A node's **clustering coefficient** is elevated if many of the node's neighbours are also each other's neighbours. It seems unsurprising that Frodo should have an elevated closeness centrality. Indeed, recall that inter-character relationships correspond to the characters' being mentioned together in the same paragraph. In Volume 1, the plot is centred on Frodo's quest. He is therefore at the heart of the happenings and is often mentioned alongside all other major characters. However, Frodo's clustering coefficient is never particularly elevated relative to other characters. In volumes 1 and 2, Sam's is, in fact, slightly higher. This could reflect the characters' personalities: while Frodo is somewhat of an introvert, Sam gladly interacts with many characters in the Shire, in Rivendell and even within the Company. Similarly to Aragorn's case in Volume 2, it seems here that our analysis give insight into not only the actions but also the personalities of the characters.  \n",
        "In Volume 2, the plots diverge, therefore it is also unsurprising that Frodo should no longer have as short a path to other characters. Indeed, in Volume 2 it is Aragorn who has maximum closeness centrality.  \n",
        "Finally, in Volume 3, Frodo's quest is still key, the battle at Minas Tirith is won, and all other main characters move out to battle yet again in order to help Frodo. Thus, it is yet again self-explanatory that Frodo should often be mentioned alongside a large variety of characters, even characters with whom he has not yet directly interacted as a person. Sam follows Frodo throughout the novel, and when others mention Frodo, they also often mention Sam. Hence, Sam's closeness and clustering are often smaller, but similar, to Frodo's.  \n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, Frodo and Sam's betweennesses do not follow the same pattern. Frodo's betweeness centrality is thrice larger than Sam's in Volume 1, ten times smaller in Volume 2, and comparable to Sam's in Volume 3. This is in line with the \"equilibrium\" in character identities I have mentioned earlier. In Frodo and Sam's duo, their betweenness tends to an equilibrium in Volume 3. A node's **betweenness centrality** relates to the number of shortest paths between other nodes on which the ndoe of interest is found. In volumes 2 and 3, maximum betweenness is held by Aragorn. This could be explained by the following: in Volume 1, Frodo is at the centre of the only plot line; he is therefore at the heart of the happenings. By Volume 2, however, it is Aragorn who is a key figure in many plot lines, and he leads several different groups of characters. His elevated closeness and betweenness as of Volume 2 seems to foretell his crowning and becoming king of a major land of Middle Earth. Sam's elevated betweenness centrality in Volume 2 seems difficult to explain, and is due, perhaps, to the imprecise nature of the measurements of interactions I have used: two characters' being mentioned in the same paragraph.  \n",
